## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Basic markup of a page to get the frame set up correctly, and some good rule-of-thumb CSS to style a page to match the required spec.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

Would like to explore using frameworks to streamline styling, and get a better grasp at pros/cons of using pure CSS vs. pre-compilers like SASS/LESS, on top of styling frameworks like Bootstrap.
